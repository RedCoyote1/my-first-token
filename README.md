# My First Token (MFT)

This is my first blockchain project.
A simple token smart contract written in Solidity.

## What this project does
- Creates a fixed supply token
- Allows transfers between addresses
- Demonstrates basic smart contract logic

## Tech stack
- Solidity
- Ethereum (testnet)
- Remix IDE
- MetaMask

## Why I built this
To learn how smart contracts work by building a real project.

## Deployment
- Remix IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org
- Testnet: Sepolia
- Deployed Contract Address: 0x224c19e181Af0BAc6B4a88004487A64756065ea9

## Proof of Deployment

Screenshots in the `/screenshots` folder show the MFT token
successfully deployed and visible in MetaMask.
